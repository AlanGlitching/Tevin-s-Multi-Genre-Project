            <p className="greeting">Dear Reader,</p>
            <p>
              I picked cyber security as my topic as I wanted to help my country to safeguard their private information as well as government data. I didn't have any prior experience with my topic but I'm interested to learn about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I knew that cyber security is to help protect data but after researching I found out that cyber security is just not about protecting data but helping out with strengthening firewalls that protects important government information from hackers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to learn more about the different types of strategies Singapore has for cyber security currently. What kind of strategies are being used by Singapore now? How many people are involved in making the strategies that Singapore uses?
            </p>
            <p>
              My information can be found in my Works Cited Page.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have learned that a lot of people came together to make a plan that is used in Singapore as well as the importance of protecting personal or important information. My questions are answered through the research that I found online that are in my Works Cited Page.
            </p>
            <p>
              My research changed my understanding of how cyber security works and how many strategies are used to counter different threats that can happen in real time. I would like my readers to know the different strategies used in a nation's cyber security and how they can protect themselves from cyber attacks or threats.
            </p>
            <p>
              The topic I picked is important in everyday life as we use technology everyday and AI has been rising over the years so it is important that we learn how we can help ourselves and other people to protect their personal information.

          <h2 className="section-title">Singapore's Cyber Security: Strategies and Plan For The Future</h2>

              While Singapore is only referred to as a tier-3 cyber power nation, the strategies that Singapore uses makes a good example for other nations should do to ensure they remain cyber safe from threats and crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order for Singapore to strengthen its cybersecurity, the prime minister has made several education and training pipelines that are available to all citizens as well as having a long-term sustainability of cyber expertise to help teach students or adults that are interested in learning cybersecurity. "Singapore made growing a robust talent pipeline a core pillar of their strategy." (PM. Loong, 2021) The strategy was only developed after consulting 50 different stakeholders in the nation. "Cybersecurity is not just a technology issue - addressing the cybersecurity challenges of today and tomorrow requires a collaborative effort from all stakeholders, including the private and public sector, to develop cyber-security talent." (Foo Siang-tse, 2016)
            </p>
            <p>
              Creating a safer cyberspace for the citizens is also one of the 4 different strategies that Singapore has implemented. In order to work towards the goal of creating a safer cyberspace in the nation, the government has decided to implement different initiatives such as the National Cybercrime Action Plan. Singapore's government also encourages sharing the responsibility of protecting Singapore's cyber space with businesses, communities, and individuals that are adopting good cybersecurity practices.
            </p>
            <p>
              Introducing scholarships, industry-focused curricula, and up-skilling/reskilling programs like Cyber Security Assessment Tools or CSAT in short, supporting start-ups, R&D programmes in different schools, and advanced cybersecurity companies, these ways shows how Singapore is going for a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem instead of a non vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem like Thailand. The government also simplified cybersecurity so it can be more accessible to the citizens, especially the elderly people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Combating cross-border cyber threats and cybercrime through bilateral and multilateral partnerships, The pdf mentions that Singapore holds the position as a leader in shaping global cyber governance despite being a small state, this adds on how serious Singapore is. Building a strong and future-ready cybersecurity workforce is part of the strategy that Singapore uses which is a good way to let future generations know or learn about cybersecurity, it's also a good way that other countries should pick up on.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Singapore goes more digital, the rate of cybercrime has gone up sharply which caused significant financial and societal harm. The vision for this plan is a safe and secure online environment for Singaporeans. The plan focuses on deterrence, detection, and disruption of cybercriminal activities. Regular upgrading capabilities and adoption of international best practices, ensuring legal tools remain effective against transnational and technologically advanced cybercrimes. Singapore created a whole new sector in their police force to centralize investigations, forensics, intelligence, and prevention. This sector of the police force uses advanced digital forensics and analytics tools to handle large-scale cybercrime cases.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is all the strategy that Singapore has now and might add more in the future as the usage of AI is getting higher over the years and Singapore and other countries might have to again come up with another plan or strategy to combat cyber threats that the AI apps might have.

            <p className="greeting">Good afternoon Andrew Walker,</p>
            <p>
              We hope you are doing well today. My name is Tevin Tan and I'm on the behalf of the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore and I'm here to inform you that we are hiring people right now and we would like to know if you would be interested in joining our agency.
            </p>
            <p>
              Normally we only hire people that have some knowledge about cyber security but we are short on stuff at the moment and are trying to find people who are interested in cyber security and wonder if you would like to join us and we will teach you the basics of cyber security. The main purpose of our agency is to help and protect personal information and government data from outsiders that are trying to steal it. Our agency is also trying to work with other citizens than just citizens who have knowledge or a diploma on cyber security. We here at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore work with different partners and schools to provide students and adults a chance at studying cyber security and get a diploma or knowledge they need to help the country's cyberspace be more secure and protected.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore we are not just a company or agency that protects Singapore's data but help me strengthen it as the digital world is also rising higher and hackers are starting to become harder to find and track so we need more hands on deck to help us find these hackers.
            </p>
            <p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

              <p>Singapore's transformation into a digitally enabled society has reshaped how peace and stability are maintained. Today, threats no longer arrive solely through physical borders, but through networks, data systems, and digital infrastructure.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jenet:</strong></p>
              <p>That shift has forced institutions to evolve. Cybersecurity is no longer a technical function operating in isolation; it has become central to governance. When state systems are vulnerable, justice, transparency, and public trust are placed at risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>
              <p>Public trust depends on continuity. If healthcare records are compromised, financial systems disrupted, or government platforms disabled, citizens begin to question the reliability of institutions meant to protect them.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jenet:</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore's cybersecurity strategy addresses this by strengthening critical infrastructure and enforcing regulatory frameworks that promote accountability. These measures ensure that institutions remain functional even under persistent cyber threats.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>
              <p>In this context, cybersecurity becomes a mechanism for justice. Secure systems protect personal data, prevent manipulation, and safeguard equal access to essential services.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jenet:</strong></p>
              <p>This aligns directly with the United Nations' Goal 16, which emphasizes peace, justice, and strong institutions. Digital resilience supports peaceful societies by reducing instability and preventing cyber incidents from escalating into wider conflict.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>
              <p>Cyber conflict, if left unmanaged, has the potential to destabilize nations without a single shot being fired. Strong cyber defenses therefore act as deterrents, reinforcing peaceful digital engagement between states.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jenet:</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore also recognizes that cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. By investing in talent development, public-private partnerships, and international cooperation, it contributes to a rules-based cyber environment.</p>

            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jerry:</strong></p>
              <p>Strong institutions are not defined by their ability to avoid attack, but by their capacity to withstand, respond, and recover. Resilience, rather than perfection, is the true measure of institutional strength.</p>
            </div>
            <div className="dialogue-item">
              <p className="speaker"><strong>Jenet:</strong></p>

          <div className="content-block">
            <p>
              I chose the order of my genres intentionally to guide the project from awareness to action. I started with informative and analytical pieces to lay the groundwork for understanding Singapore's cybersecurity landscape and its link to Sustainable Development Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions. Once readers grasped the facts and policies, I moved into more creative formats like dialogue, poetry, and repetends to humanize the issue. I wanted the structure to show that cybersecurity is not just about policy and strategy; it impacts real people in everyday life. Finally, I concluded with reflective and persuasive pieces to highlight responsibility and collective action.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each writing entry connects through the central theme of digital security as a foundation for peace and institutional strength. The informative essay explains the systems and strategies in place. The business email showcases professional communication within institutions. The dialogue illustrates how cybersecurity affects citizens and youth. The poem adds emotional depth, reminding readers that behind every firewall and encrypted network are human lives and trust. Together, these genres create a layered understanding: cybersecurity protects not just data, but also stability, justice, and national resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
              My inspiration came from seeing how dependent modern society is on technology. In Singapore, digital systems drive healthcare, banking, education, and government services. I realized that cyber threats are not just abstract ideas—they can disrupt crucial services and damage trust in institutions. This understanding led me to view cybersecurity as more than a technical concern; it is key to maintaining peace and justice in the digital age.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through this project, I hope to inspire students and young digital citizens. Many people my age see cybersecurity as something distant or only relevant to IT professionals. However, SDG 16 reminds us that strong institutions need informed and responsible citizens. By understanding cybersecurity, we contribute to stability and trust in our digital society. I want readers to recognize that even small actions, like practicing safe online behavior, support broader global goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              The genre I am most proud of is the dialogue and repetend comic. It allowed me to discuss a serious topic in an engaging and relatable way. Turning complex cybersecurity concepts into relatable characters and conversations was creatively challenging but made the message more impactful. It showed me that education doesn't always have to be formal to be meaningful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Overall, this multi-genre project illustrates that cybersecurity is closely tied to peace, justice, and strong institutions. Protecting digital systems means protecting society itself. By blending research with creative expression, I presented cybersecurity not just as a policy issue but as a shared responsibility in building a safer and more resilient future.
